# simble-1-to-6-dice
simple one to six dice

i hold my (simple) creation by the apache lisence 



==========================================================================================


how it works 

first it import random witch is basicly a script to randomise things

then we make a list / list in a variable 

like testvab = [1 , 2 , 3 ,4 , 5 , 6]

then it makes a if command 
that say in english terms 

if the number is 6 then say 
the number six the console 
or any other plays

(i also added so massages after the numbers to make it less boring)
